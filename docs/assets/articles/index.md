Nebular is a set of essential modules for your next Angular application.
Its primary goal is to assemble together and connect the most awesome features and libraries creating an efficient ecosystem to speed up and simplify the development.

In simpler words, Nebular is a set of generic modules (components, services & styles) helping you to solve generic tasks easier and focus on business logic.
